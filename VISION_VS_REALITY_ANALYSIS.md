## Recommended Strategy

### Option A: "Narrow and Deep" (RECOMMENDED)
Focus ONLY on Discovery API and corridor formation for 6 months:
1. Import all FERC data immediately
2. Build world-class corridor optimizer
3. Get 10 pilot projects using it
4. Prove 74% cost savings
5. Raise Series A on proven traction

### Option B: "Full Vision Sprint"
Try to build all three layers simultaneously:
- High risk of failure
- Requires $3M+ immediate funding
- 20+ person team needed
- 18-24 month timeline

### Option C: "Partner Strategy"
Partner with existing platforms:
1. Data: Partner with Bloomberg/Refinitiv
2. Simulation: Partner with ESRI
3. Financing: Partner with Republic/StartEngine
- Faster to market
- Less control
- Revenue sharing required

## The Brutal Truth

**We have built 15% of the vision with compelling demos but no real data.**

The vision document describes a $100M+ platform that would take 50+ engineers 3-5 years to fully build. We have:
- A beautiful vision
- A working prototype
- Zero real data
- One developer

**The opportunity is real. The gap is massive.**

Success requires either:
1. Dramatic scope reduction (Option A)
2. Significant funding/team (Option B)
3. Strategic partnerships (Option C)

**My recommendation: Option A - Become the world's best at corridor formation. Win that battle first. Expand later.**
